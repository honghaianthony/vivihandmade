# [NEXTJS] Vivi Handmade - Website for handbags

## Introduction

Here is my javascript source code with my friend. A website is customized from Creative Tim Template and for SEO purposes.

## Motivation

My team has decided to implement this project because we want to know about SEO (Search Engine Optimization). To SEO successfully, I have use NextJS which is a framework that supports SSR and SSG. On the other hand, to increase performance for user experience, I have use some fonts from `fontsource.org` which is developed by Vercel, icons from `iconify.design`, reduce some unnecessary javascript, optimize image resolution, set metadata for website, etc...

## Results

I am happy to announce that our website has indexed by Google. It takes a lot of effort to make it to top 1 by searching on Google. You can see some results below
